    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="list3">Bring the <u>Napoleon invasions</u> to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until Latin America is nice and chaotic, and the ruling government is deposed, 
            5-7 years.</li>
        <li class="list3">Place the revolution leaders: <u>Bolivar, Hidalgo and Morelos</u> into another saucepan, and cover with Enlightenment ideas and motivations by 1 inch. 
            Cover the saucepan and bring the mix to a boil over high heat. After that, mix this with the chaos of Napoleon Invasions, this will create
            an explosive effect of a series of violent conflicts. But stay calm and let it simmer for 20 years.</li>
        <li class="list3">While it's simmering, throw in some extra ingredients such as the <u>Jamaica Letter of 1815</u> as well as 
            <u>general Iturbide and commander Guerrero</u> to improve the taste. You should see in the pot that for a short period a portion of the pot integrates into <u>Gran Columbia</u>, 
            but separates again in 11 years</li>
        <li class="list3">For the Chile and Lima portion, use the spice of <u>José de San Martín</u> to eliminate the last bit of Spanish bitterness</li>
        <li class="list3">throw out the Peninsulares as we don't need them anymore</li>
        <li class="list3">Place <u>Prince Pedro</u> in the Brazilian portion, and puree until Brazil declares its independence as a constitutional monarchical country in 1822.</li>
        <li class="list3">To assemble the dish, oil a flexible plastic bowl (at least 1 continent size) and press Latin American nationalism into the bottom to fill 1/3 of the bowl. Layer about 3/4 inch of independence over the rice, 
            and top with powerful creoles to fill the bowl.  
        </li>

    <h2>Outcome of Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        Once you finish the cooking steps, you would have to wait for another 78 years for this revolutionary 
        dish to be fully ready. Unfortunately many parts of the dish will not stay together anymore by then and will fall into smaller pieces.
        This dish focuses on preserving the natural taste of the ingredients, so raw tastes such as inequality, powerful churches, and patriarchy will remain in the dish even after the cooking steps are complete.
        Especially in portions like Brazil where not much flavor is added, the bitter taste of slavery will remain until 1888.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you wait, the flavor will kick in and create tastes more violent due to wars in the Mexico and Venezuela portion, killing over one million population. The dish will eventually be filled with instability and impoverishment.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the dish does brings out new and often unique tastes such as popular sovereignty, sense of identity and unity within Latin America, and of course independence from the Spanish government.
